- Password reuse is prohibited for a minimum of 6 cycles.

#### 7. **Network Security**
- Firewalls must be implemented to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- A VPN must be used for all remote connections to the internal network.
- Network segmentation should be used to isolate sensitive systems from general business operations.

#### 8. **Endpoint Security**
- Antivirus software must be installed on all company devices and updated regularly.
- All company-owned devices must have disk encryption enabled.
- Devices not in use for more than 30 days must be decommissioned or secured.

#### 9. **Backup and Recovery**
- Daily backups of critical data will be performed.
- Backups will be encrypted and stored in a secure off-site location.
- Regular restoration tests will be performed every 6 months.

#### 10. **Incident Reporting**
- Employees must report any suspected security incidents, including phishing attempts, data breaches, or malware infections, immediately to the IT Administrator.
  
#### 11. **Acceptable Use Policy**
- Employees must not use company resources for illegal or unethical activities.

### Small Business Incident Response Plan (IRP)

#### 1. **Purpose**
The purpose of this Incident Response Plan is to ensure a rapid and effective response to cybersecurity incidents that could impact business operations or compromise sensitive data.

#### 2. **Incident Response Team (IRT)**
- **Incident Response Lead**: IT Administrator
- **Business Owner**: Oversees critical decision-making.
- **Legal/Compliance**: Advises on regulatory and legal requirements.
- **Communications**: Manages internal and external communications during the incident.

#### 3. **Incident Definition**
A security incident is any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of business data or systems. Examples include:
- Data breaches
- Malware infections
- Phishing attacks
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Unauthorized access to systems

#### 4. **Incident Response Phases**

**1. Preparation**
- Ensure all staff know how to report incidents and are trained to recognize security threats.
- Keep response tools (e.g., antivirus, backup systems) updated.

**2. Detection and Analysis**
- Monitor for suspicious activities, such as failed login attempts, unusual network traffic, and malware alerts.
- Logs from security devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS) should be regularly reviewed for signs of incidents.
- Upon identifying a potential incident, the IRT will initiate the response.

**3. Containment**
- **Short-term containment**: Disconnect affected devices from the network to prevent further spread of malware or unauthorized access.
- **Long-term containment**: Implement patches, firewall rules, or access control changes to ensure the threat is mitigated.

**4. Eradication**
- Identify and remove the root cause of the incident (e.g., malware removal, patching vulnerabilities).
- Restore systems to a secure state, ensuring that backups are clean before restoration.

**5. Recovery**
- Restore normal operations by bringing affected systems back online after confirming that no malware or security vulnerabilities remain.
- Closely monitor systems to ensure that the incident does not recur.

**6. Lessons Learned**
- Conduct a post-incident review within 1 week of the incident resolution.
- Document the cause, impact, and response steps, and update policies or procedures as needed to prevent future incidents.

#### 5. **Incident Reporting**
- All incidents must be logged and reported to the Business Owner and the Incident Response Lead immediately.
- For incidents involving customer data or regulatory implications, external parties such as legal advisors and law enforcement may need to be contacted.

#### 6. **Communications Plan**
- Internal communications will be managed by the Business Owner, ensuring that only authorized personnel are informed.
- External communications, including notifying customers or regulatory bodies, must be handled by the Communications Lead.

#### 7. **Post-Incident Activities**
- Once the incident is contained and resolved, the IRT will review the effectiveness of the response and update the incident response plan as necessary.
- Lessons learned will be shared with staff to improve security practices and prevent future incidents.

This security policy and incident response plan should be reviewed annually and updated to accommodate changes in business operations, technology, and security threats.
